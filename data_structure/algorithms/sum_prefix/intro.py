# Given an array arr[] of size n, the task is to find the prefix sum of the array. 
# A prefix sum array is another array prefixSum[] of the same size, such that 
# prefixSum[i] is arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] . . . arr[i].
# Examples: 
# Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 10, 5, 15]
# Output: 10 30 40 45 60
# Explanation: For each index i, add all the elements from 0 to i:
# prefixSum[0] = 10, 
# prefixSum[1] = 10 + 20 = 30, 
# prefixSum[2] = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 and so on.
